# Overview

At my first attempt of using SQLite with python I wanted to create a program that would build some basic queries just so that I could get my head wrapped around the interaction between the two. The .csv file that I am using is a file iI got from Data.World containing random vehicles with the model years between 1970 and 1982. It contains basic information about them such as their weight, mpg, horsepower and other information. The program allows the user to make basic queries to the database and retrieve information about the cars. It allows the user to set general parameters for queries and also allows user to store the information that they query into an inventory.

# Relational Database

Utilized a SQLite database
I used pandas to import the .csv file into the database. It is a single table. 

# Development Environment

SQLite

# Future Work

* Find a database including cars from a larger time period
* Allow user to build custom queris
* Allow users to store and manage an inventory of their favorite cars
